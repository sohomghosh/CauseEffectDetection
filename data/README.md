This folder should contain data files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`(, `val.csv`). These datasets are obtained from the organisers and might require renaming. 

You may obtain `train.txt`, `test.txt`, `train_transitions.txt` (,`val.txt`) by running `preprocess.py` before running the train, evaluate or predict codes in `run.py`.
